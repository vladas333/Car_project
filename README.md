# Car_project
Was copied automotive-model-year-data getted from Github repository, with free use licence.
It was made in MySQL database, so was writed a code to export it to MongoDB (file name mysql_to_mongodb.py).

app.py show selected cars by model. In commented line 21, could change in year filter.

app_2.py not work properly yet. Try to make complex query.
